    "# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to build, evaluate, and compare classification models with a strong emphasis on **medical recall**, ensuring that diabetic cases are correctly identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis follows an end-to-end data science workflow including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and model persistence for deployment readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Early detection of diabetes is critical in reducing long-term health complications. Traditional diagnostic approaches can miss early-stage cases. This project aims to leverage machine learning models to improve diagnostic accuracy, particularly by minimizing false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
